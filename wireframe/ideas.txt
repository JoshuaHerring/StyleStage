Description
The idea for our web page is that as we scroll down the webpage the sun will start in
the center then fade to the side as it and the background changes color from warm
daytime colors to sunset colors. Then it will change into night time colors as the
moon comes back up. If we are unable to change it with the scroll then we will
just have the animation slowly play in the back-round. Throughout the animation
the backround is all static but the text will scroll up instead of the backround
scrolling.
